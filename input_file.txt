You have power over your mind
not outside events
Realize this
and you will find strength
The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts
Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be
Be one
The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury
Our life is what our thoughts make it
It is not death that a man should fear
but he should fear never beginning to live
